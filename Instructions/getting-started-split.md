# Developing a Multimodal RAG Solution

### Overall Estimated Duration : 60 minutes

## Overview

This hands-on lab guides you through building and automating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution. You will explore how to ingest diverse data sources while leveraging AI models like text embeddings, language models, and generative AI capabilities.

## Objective

Learn to build and automate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, leveraging AI models like text embeddings, language models, and generative AI. By the end of this lab, you will get insights on these concepts:

- **Build Retrieval Augmented Generation solution in Azure AI Foundry:** Learn to ingest data into a system powered by Azure AI tools and preprocess it using GPT-4 Turbo and text embedding models.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites:

- **Familiarity with Azure Resources:** Basic understanding of Azure services and the Azure portal for managing cloud resources.

- **Understanding of RAG Concepts:** Basic knowledge of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its applications in AI workflows.

## Architecture

The architecture facilitates the seamless ingestion and retrieval of data for user interactions. Documents are stored in Azure Blob Storage, which serves as the source for data ingestion. AI Studio processes these documents using models from Azure AI Services via the chat playground. The processed data is indexed using AI Search, allowing efficient retrieval.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves several key components:

- **Azure Blob Storage:** Serves as the primary data repository, storing documents that will be ingested into the system. This ensures secure and scalable storage for unprocessed data.

- **AI Studio:** Acts as the ingestion layer where documents from Azure Blob Storage are processed. It leverages Azure AI Services to apply language models for extracting relevant information and preparing it for indexing.

- **Azure AI Services:** Provides the advanced AI models, including language understanding and generative capabilities, used by AI Studio to extract data and process user interactions efficiently.

- **Azure AI Search:** Creates semantic indexes from the processed data, enabling efficient and meaningful retrieval of information. This component supports enhanced search capabilities by understanding user queries contextually.

## Getting Started with Lab
